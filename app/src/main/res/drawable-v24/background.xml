<!--Recycler view lists and grids are frequently used to create a selectable interface,
that is, a list of data items that the user can choose from. The recycler view doesn't
automatically give the user a visual indication of selection status though, that's up to you.
In order to implement a selectable color, you must create your own files. You could use simple
colors as backgrounds, but you can create a more interesting appearance with xml based drawable
and shape files.-->

<!--

 Now my first job will be to create a shape. The shape will have a fill and a color (White),
 and it'll have a border. I'll change this file's root element name to shape, then within that
 I'll add a solid child element, and I'll set the color attribute to pound f-f-f.
 This is going to be the default background color, it'll be white. Next I'll add a border.
  I'll do that with a stroke element. I'll set the width to 3dp, and the color to a custom
  color of B1BCBE. This could be any color you like. And then, just to make this visually
  interesting, I'll add a corner radius, using the corners element, and I'll set the radius to 10dp.
   So that's the default color.

<shape xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
    <solid android:color="#FFF" />
    <stroke android:width="3dp" android:color="#B1BCBE"/>
    <corners android:radius="10dp"/>

</shape>

<!-- Now I'll make a copy of this file to use as the shape that's displayed when the user
presses an item. We will call it background_selected.xml -->
