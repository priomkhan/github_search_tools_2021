<!--t starts with a selector element at the root. I'm going to add two items.
 First I'll add the item for the color that will be displayed when the user is pressing,
  or clicking on an item. I'll use an item element, I'll set the drawable attribute to the
  background selected drawable, and then I'll add an attribute called state pressed equals true.
  And that means, when the user is pressing on the item, show this background.

   Next I'll add another item, and this is the default color, and I'll choose the simple
   background element. It's important to declare these in exactly this order. The more specific
   background first, the default at second.
